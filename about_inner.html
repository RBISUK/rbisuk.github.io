    <p class="mb-4">Ryan Roberts is the founder of RBIS (Behavioural &amp; Intelligence Services), an independent strategist, builder, and consultant at the intersection of compliance, technology, and behavioural science.

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-center">About RBIS</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">RBIS Intelligence is built around one principle: <strong>evidence comes first</strong>. We design software, audits, and reporting frameworks that don’t just “look good” but stand up to scrutiny from regulators, auditors, and courts. Our products and services are designed to be audit-ready, compliant by default, and supported by embedded intelligence that adapts in real time.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">Unlike traditional agencies, RBIS isn’t about vanity metrics or surface-level fixes. We engineer systems that keep organisations safe, efficient, and competitive in a regulatory environment where compliance is no longer optional — it’s survival.</p>
