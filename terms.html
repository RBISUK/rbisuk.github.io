  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p>These terms govern your use of RBIS websites, demos, dashboards and the supply of our analysis and reports. By ordering or using our services you agree to these terms.</p>

  <h2>1. Services &amp; Scope</h2>
  <p>RBIS provides independent behavioural and intelligence analysis, reports and supporting software tools. We do <b>not</b> provide legal advice or representation. Any legal decisions remain your responsibility.</p>

  <h2>2. Ordering &amp; Fees</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Quotes specify scope, deliverables, fee and turnaround.</li>
    <li>Fixed fees apply to defined scope; out-of-scope work requires written approval and may incur additional fees.</li>
    <li>Unless stated, fees exclude VAT and third-party costs (e.g., transcription, court fees).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Your Responsibilities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide accurate, lawful materials and authority to share them with us.</li>
    <li>Ensure timely access to required stakeholders and systems.</li>
    <li>Decide how to act on findings; RBIS does not replace professional legal, medical, or financial advice.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Confidentiality</h2>
  <p>Each party must keep non-public information confidential and use it only to perform the contract, except where disclosure is required by law. We may anonymise and aggregate insights to improve our methods; such data will not identify you.</p>

  <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>Pre-existing IP remains with its owner. Upon full payment, you receive a non-exclusive licence to use the deliverables internally and for the specific case/project they were produced for. Re-use across other matters may require permission.</p>

  <h2>6. Compliance</h2>
  <p>We process personal data under the Privacy Policy. You confirm you have a lawful basis to share any personal data with us.</p>

  <h2>7. Warranties &amp; Disclaimers</h2>
  <p>We provide services with reasonable skill and care. We do not warrant that outputs will meet every objective or guarantee any legal outcome. Demos are provided “as is”.</p>

  <h2>8. Liability</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Nothing excludes liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence, fraud, or any liability that cannot be excluded by law.</li>
    <li>Subject to the above, our aggregate liability arising from any services is limited to the fees paid (or payable) for the service giving rise to the claim in the 12 months prior to the event.</li>
    <li>We are not liable for indirect or consequential loss, lost profits, or loss of data where backups or originals are not supplied.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>9. Term &amp; Cancellation</h2>
  <p>Either party may terminate for material breach not cured within 14 days of notice. On termination, you pay for completed work and committed third-party costs. Some clauses (confidentiality, IP, liability limits) survive termination.</p>

  <h2>10. Force Majeure</h2>
  <p>Neither party is liable for delays caused by events beyond reasonable control (e.g., major outages, natural disasters, war, regulatory action).</p>

  <h2>11. Publicity</h2>
  <p>We will not name you in marketing without permission. You may reference RBIS internally and in filings where required.</p>

  <h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
  <p>These terms are governed by the laws of England &amp; Wales. Courts of England &amp; Wales have exclusive jurisdiction.</p>

  <h2>13. Contact</h2>
